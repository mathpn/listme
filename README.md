# rememberme
A Python package to summarize all FIXME, TODO and related tags of a project

## TODO

[x] summary per file
[x] colorful output with emojis
[x] complete regex (right now it's too simple) to find tags
[x] option to customize tags
[ ] configuration wizard (emoji support)
[ ] multiline comment support (may be difficult and not worth it?)
[x] git integration to show git authors optionally

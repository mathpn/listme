# rememberme
A Python package to summarize all FIXME, TODO and related tags of a project

## TODO

[ ] summary per file
[ ] colorful output with emojis
[ ] complete regex (right now it's too simple) to find tags
[ ] option to customize tags
[ ] configuration wizard (emoji support)
[ ] multiline comment support (may be difficult and not worth it?)
[ ] gitpython integration to show git hashes and authors optionally
